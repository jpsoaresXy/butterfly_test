# 🦋 Butterfly 3D Animation 🌪️

Welcome to the **Butterfly 3D Animation (Thinking...??)** project! This project features an interactive 3D animation of a beautiful blue butterfly that you can control with the scroll of your mouse.

## Why?
The blue butterfly appears in one of my favorite games, **Life is Strange**. Life is strange, and Max returns now as **Life is Strange: Double Exposure**, and I'm inspired by it. Although I'm not an artist, I decided to experiment with some technologies and try to create art through coding. 🌟

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Animation**: Control the flight of the butterfly by scrolling.
- **High-Quality Model**: The butterfly is rendered with stunning detail.
- **Smooth Controls**: Experience smooth and responsive scrolling animations.

## 📚 Description

This project utilizes **React Three Fiber** and **Three.js** to create a 3D animation of a butterfly 🦋. As you scroll through the page, the butterfly flaps its wings and flies around, creating an immersive experience.

"This action will have consequences..." 🌪️

Remember, every scroll you make affects the butterfly's flight.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js.
- **Three.js**: A 3D library that makes WebGL simpler.
- **React Three Drei**: Useful helpers for working with Three.js in React.

## 🌱 Project Status

This project is just beginning. My goal is to create something cool and artistic while testing these 3D manipulation technologies.
